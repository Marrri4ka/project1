            <h2>About Myself</h2>
            <p>I hold a graduate degree in <em>German linguistics.</em>My professional
              life was focused on the teaching of the German language. When
              I had my first child, it was clear to me that she needed me more
               than my students needed me, so I reduced my working hours to the
               minimum and started to work exclusively online in the evening.

Now it is the time to come back to work. The return is not easy: I need to
challenge myself professionally by changing my career.
There is no doubt in my mind that<strong> modern technologies  transform world now and
 will transform it in the future.</strong> I want become such game changer.
 I want to be an engineer as I have tried few online courses and loved it! I have ideas
  how to apply technologies to solve these problems.
 The gap between learning German and programming is huge, but at the same time
 there are many common themes: every letter matters; the smallest twist can
 change the meaning completely.
I can be successful at Ada as I strongly value inclusivity: living in 3
countries in the past 4 years and being non-native speaker & foreigner I
 understand and spread the value of diversity, building connections and making
 sure everyone can be welcomed in this very unique  world.
